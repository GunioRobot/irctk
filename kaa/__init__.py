    A simple framework for IRC applications written in Python.
    
    
    For a long hour Mowgli lay back among the coils, while Kaa, his head 
    motionless on the ground, thought of all that he had seen and known since 
    the day he came from the egg.
    
    The light seemed to go out of his eyes and leave them like stale opals, 
    and now and again he made little stiff passes with his head, right and 
    left, as though he were hunting in his sleep. Mowgli dozed quietly, for he 
    knew that there is nothing like sleep before hunting, and he was trained 
    to take it at any hour of the day or night. Then he felt Kaa's back grow 
    bigger and broader below him as the huge python puffed himself out, 
    hissing with the noise of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard; 
    
    "I have seen all the dead seasons," Kaa said at last, "and the great trees 
    and the old elephants, and the rocks that were bare and sharp-pointed ere 
    the moss grew. Art thou still alive, Manling?"
